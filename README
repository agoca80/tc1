GETTING THE SERVER

go get github.com/agoca80/tc1

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

RUNNING THE SERVER

go run github.com/agoca80/tc1

or

cd $GOPATH/github/agoca80/tc1
go install
$GOPATH/bin/tc1

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

TESTING THE SERVER

There are two easy ways of testing the server:

- To check the server input and output, just run the script test.sh

bash tests.sh

This script will launch a synthetic client and a server. The client will
send the termination signal after 10 seconds. Due to the pipeline process
delay, the server may run a little longer. Once the server has finished, it
will compare the input and number.log for discrepancies in the uniques 
numbers seen in both files

- Using the go test -run=Server

This mode is useful to test the server with a custom client.
Remember to change the test timeout if you will be running the server for
a long time. This may be used also to get profiling information:

go test -cpuprofile profile.cpu -run=Server
go test -blockprofile profile.block -run=Server
go test -memprofile profile.mem -run=Server

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

PROFILING

Run the ./profile.sh script to get the profiling of the server

Also, you may review the profiling from my workstation tests with ./review.sh
