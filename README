RUNNING THE SERVER

To run the server, you must specify the mode. There are two options:
- server
- client

The client option is just for testing purposes

To run the server, you needd to execute the command below:

go run main.go server

TESTING THE SERVER

There are two easy ways of testing the server:

- If you want to check the server input and output, just run the script test.sh

bash tests.sh

This script will launch a sintetic client and a server. The client will send the termination
signal after 10 seconds. Due to the pipeline process delay, the server may run a little longer
Once the server has finished, it will compare the input and number.log for discrepancies in the
uniques numbers seen in both files

- Using the go test -run=Server

This mode is useful to test the server with a custom client
This may be used also to get profiling information:

go test -cpuprofile profile.cpu -run=Server
go test -blockprofile profile.block -run=Server
go test -memprofile profile.mem -run=Server

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

PROFILING

Run the ./profile.sh script to get the profiling of the server
